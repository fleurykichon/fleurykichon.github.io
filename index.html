    <h1>The Château de Chenonceau</h1></header>
  <p>The Château de Chenonceau is a French château spanning the River Cher, near the small village of Chenonceaux in the Indre-et-Loire <i>département</i> of the Loire Valley in France. It is one of the best-known châteaux of the Loire valley.     </p>
  <p>The estate of Chenonceau is first mentioned in writing in the 11th century. The current château was built in 1514–1522 on the foundations of an old mill and was later extended to span the river. The bridge over the river was built (1556-1559) to designs by the French Renaissance architect <strong>Philibert de l'Orme,</strong> and the gallery on the bridge, built from 1570–1576 to designs by <b class="person">Jean Bullant.</b> </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>An architectural mixture of late Gothic and early Renaissance, Château de Chenonceau and its gardens are open to the public. Other than the Royal Palace of Versailles, it is the most visited château in France.</p> <p>The château has been classified as a Monument historique since 1840 by the French Ministry of Culture. Today, Chenonceau is a major tourist attraction and in 2007 received around 800,000 visitors.</p>
  <h3>History</h3>
    <h4><b>The Marques family</b></h4>
  <p>In the 13th century, the fief of Chenonceau belonged to the Marques family. The original château was torched in 1412 to punish owner <b class="person">Jean Marques</b> for an act of sedition. He rebuilt a château and fortified mill on the site in the 1430s. Jean Marques's indebted heir <b class="person">Pierre Marques</b> found it necessary to sell.</p>
  <h5>Thomas Bohier</h5>
  <p> <b class="person">Thomas Bohier,</b> Chamberlain to King Charles VIII of France, purchased the castle from Pierre Marques in 1513 (this leads to 2013 being considered the 500th anniversary of the castle: MDXIII–MMXIII.) Bohier demolished the castle, though its 15th-century keep was left standing, and built an entirely new residence between 1515 and 1521. The work was overseen by his wife <b class="person">Katherine Briçonnet,</b> who delighted in hosting French nobility, including <b>King Francis I</b> on two occasions.</p>
  <h6>Diane de Poitiers</h6>
  <p>In 1535 the château was seized from Bohier's son by King Francis I of France for unpaid debts to the Crown; after Francis' death in 1547, Henry II offered the château as a gift to his mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who became fervently attached to the château along the river. In 1555 she commissioned <emphasis>Philibert de l'Orme</emphasis> to build the arched bridge joining the château to its opposite bank. Diane then oversaw the planting of extensive flower and vegetable gardens along with a variety of fruit trees. Set along the banks of the river, but buttressed from flooding by stone terraces, the exquisite gardens were laid out in four triangles.</p>

  <p>Diane de Poitiers was the unquestioned mistress of the castle, but ownership remained with the crown until 1555, when years of delicate legal maneuvers finally yielded possession to her.</p>
    <h7><strong>Catherine de' Medici</strong></h7>
  <p> After <b class="person">King Henry II</b> died in 1559, his strong-willed widow and regent Catherine de' Medici forced Diane to exchange it for the Château Chaumont. Queen Catherine then made Chenonceau her own favorite residence, adding a new series of gardens.</p>
