    <p>There is a bedroom in Chenonceau Castle that is completely black. The walls, bedding, and curtains are all black. I wanted to find out why after having visited the castle. The reason it is black is because of Louise de Lorraine.</p>
    <h2><strong>Louise de Lorraine</strong></h2>
    <p>On Catherine's death in 1589 the château went to her daughter-in-law, Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont, wife of King Henry III. Within an eight-month period following Diane de Poitiers' death, Louise of Lorraine had lost both her mother-in-law and her husband, Henry III. She entered a period of mourning that lasted the rest of her life. At Chenonceau Louise was told of her husband's assassination in 1589 and she fell into a state of depression, spending the remainder of her days wandering aimlessly along the château's corridors dressed in mourning clothes amidst somber black tapestries stitched with skulls and crossbones.</p>
    <h3><strong>A Woman Who Stood By Her Man</strong></h3>
    <p>A quiet, devout woman, Louise loved her husband dearly in spite of his being the Black Sheep of the royal family. He was known for his cross-dressing, effeminate behavior, and alleged infidelities with male favorites.2 In Henry III's memory, sad Louise wore white, the French color of mourning.</p>
    <h4><b>A Lifetime Hobby of Grieving</b></h4>
    <p>Louise gave away much of her personal fortune to charity. She changed little about Chenonceau, except for her own room (which she had painted black and decorated in dark feathers, bones, and the tools of gravediggers). How macabre! Her death in 1601 marked the end of the royals at Chenonceau. For the next hundred years, the castle fell into relative neglect.</p>
